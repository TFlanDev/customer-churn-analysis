# customer-churn-analysis

## Overview
This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The goal is to identify customers who are at a high risk of leaving, allowing a business to take proactive retention measures.

### Dataset
The analysis is performed on the Telco Customer Churn Dataset. This dataset contains customer account information, demographic data, and details on the services each customer has signed up for.

### Libraries
<li>Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis</li>
<li>Matplotlib and Seaborn - Data visualizations</li>
<li>Scikit-learn : Building and evaluating Logistic Regression Model</li>
